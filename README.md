# Tangram

Tangram is a programmable build system and package manager. Use it as an alternative to Bazel or Buck2, Nix or Guix, and Docker or Podman to:

1. Build isolated, reproducible environments where all dependencies are content addressed and locked with a lockfile.
2. Build your projects with fine-grained and distributed caching and execution.

## Quickstart

```
curl https://tangram.dev/install.sh | sh
```
